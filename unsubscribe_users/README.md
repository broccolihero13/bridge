# Unsubscribe Users

The unsubscribe user script is used to update a CSV list of users in order to prevent them from receiving Bridge notifications.

# Requirements and usage

The unsubscribe script requires a Bridge API token to be generated with Account Admin set as the role.

Use cases:

- Perform notifications can only be turned off by unsubscribing the user, this script will accomplish that.
- Disable notifications on a user by user basis

# Error File Produced
This script will put an error CSV in the same folder as the script when it is complete.

# Bridge
Bridge is a new LMS geared towards the corporate space. For additional information,
visit [https://www.getbridge.com/](https://www.getbridge.com/)

# Support
As always, all the files are provided AS-IS, without warranty, and without any support beyond this
document and anyone kind enough to help from the community.

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in mind. Instructure won't be
able to help you fix or debug this. That said, the community will hopefully help support
and keep both the script and this documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
